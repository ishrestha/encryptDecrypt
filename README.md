# encryptDecrypt
This is program that uses 3 encyption and decryption method namely caesar, substitution and enigma (3ring).
Once the program runs, it asks for file name, type of encryption, and to encrypt or decrypt.

Caesar: This asks for one number of letters to replace the encrypted letter with.  For example if you input 2, this will take
the letter and replace it with after 2 letters. Suppose for d it would replace as f and for a as c and z as a and space with b. 
Space is at the end

Substitution: I have a replace each letter with some other unique letter in a list. This encryption will be random and pretty 
hard to figure out than caesar subsitution

3-ring (enigma): Most sophisticated encryption. Please research about this before tyring to understand it.
